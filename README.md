# FundTasy
.Hack HEAP 2024 Summer Program Project

FundTasy aims to provide a way for people to Save Funds to live their fantasy.

### Track Spending, Save More

Users earn a daily "allowance" based on their monthly income and daily transactions are logged manually.
Our app allows users to add items from Amazon to their wishlist, and set them as goals to reach.

### Earn Coinks & Collect Pigs

With every cent saved, we reward our users with 1 Coink, which is FundTasy's very own in-game currency. Coinks are used to purchase different pigs in the store, which the user can then display on their profile.

### Compete With Friends
FundTasy doubles up as a social platform, where users can find their peers and add them as friends, creating a friendly and competitive environment which promotes saving money.

### Honesty Is Our Best Policy
FundTasy is centered around individual integrity, and is targeted at young people who are looking for solutions to help them actively save money.
