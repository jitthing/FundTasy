# FundTasy
.Hack HEAP 2024 Summer Program Project

###
Funtasy aims to provide a way for people to Save Funds to live their fantasy.
Our app allows users to add items from Amazon to their wishlist, and set them as goals to reach.
Users earn a daily "allowance" based on their monthly income and daily transactions are logged manually.
Funtasy doubles up as a social platform, where users can find their peers and add them as friends, creating a competitive like environment which promotes saving money.
With every cent saved, we reward our users with 1 Coink. Coinks are used to purchase different pigs in the store, which the user can then display on their profile.
Our app is centered around honesty, and is targetted at people who are looking at solutions to help them actively save money.
